# Hack School Fall 2024

Welcome to the main repository for ACM Hack's Hack School for Fall 2024!

## Preparing for Hack School

If you want to get a head start on hack school content, we have our Hack Textbook [here](https://hack.acmucsd.com/hack-school) with in-depth content for the material that we cover in our workshops! We recommend checking out the **Git/Github** and **Developer Tools** section to set up your coding environment for hack school. You can also check out our past iteration of [Hack School](https://acmurl.com/hackschool-fa23) to learn about another project that you can create with the MERN stack, a type-racing game ðŸš—.
